## Supported Versions

This project uses [Bevry's automated tooling](https://github.com/bevry/boundation) to deliver the latest updates, fixes, and improvements in the latest release while still maintaining widespread ecosystem compatibility.

Furthermore, our CI publishes each successful build on the ['master]' branch](https://github.com/bevry/wait/actions?query=branch%3Amaster) to the `@next` [version tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/config#tag).
